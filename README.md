# Desktop
Python application to organize Desktop

# Build the app for Mac
To build the app make sure to have newest Python and py2app library
It did not work for me until I updated the libraries
- I installed the newest Python version via brew `python 3.7.5`
- pip install -U py2app gave me this version `py2app==0.19`
